# KafaGym Website

Welcome to [KafaGym](https://kafamem.github.io/msone-kafagym)

## Project rationale

The KafaGym project aimed at creating a website that targets gym members as site's users.<br>
The main idea being to provide potential members with the needed information to better know <br>
about the gym and what are the procedures. These procedures involve becoming members and get to <br>
know how the gym works.

Therefore, at KafaGym our interest is to attract members and retain them through the provision of a better service as documented on the website.<br>

## User Experience (UX)

The website seeks to attract potential members at KafaGym. It has been designed in such way that its visitors will be able to navigate the <br>
the content easily and with help of eye catching features to attract their attention hence motivate their participation.

</ul> 

### Design<br>
<ul>
    <li>Colour Scheme</li><br>
    - Three main colours (white, orange and dark grey) were used throught the entire design process of the site. They originated from the branding logo KafaGym <br>
    which a gym logo from shutterstock customized to meet the KafaGym needs with help of Ai (Adobe Illustrator) where the joined coined word 'Kafa' is word a two syllable <br>
    word with 'Ka' standing for 'Karenzi' and 'Fa' standing for 'Fabrice'; the names of the site developer then the word gym.<br><br>
    <li>Typography</li><br>
    - The Roboto font is the main font used for the entire website with Sans Serif as the backup font in case Roboto font does not respond correctly.<br>
    The Roboto font looks nicer on web pages.<br><br>
    <li>Imagery</li><br>
    The site was designed with high resolution images to make it look attractive. The logo designed with help of Ai was <br>created with a transparent background
    and is a vector based logo which makes it adjustable to various 'witdh' values without losing its original resolution.<br>
</ul>

### Wireframes
<ul>
    <li>Home Page Wireframe - <![Landing Page](https://link)></li><br>

## Features

### Existing Features
<ul>
    <li>The site is responsive on all device sizes</li><br>
    <li>Cards on home page are interactive upon hovering</li><br>
    <li>The eKafaGym app link on About Us page targets to function after learning about software develpment. For now, it <br> 
    only points to membership sign up page.</li><br>
</ul>

### Features Left to implement
<ul>
    <li>Upon completing the JavaScript module, I hope to bring the site more to life through the design and use of interactive features.</li><br>
    <li>The showcase background picture on home which is now fixed will be replaced by a JavaScript slider function to allow a quick scan of<br>
    site content but at the same time creating an interactive site function.<br>
    <li>JavaScript will all also intervene in creating an interchangeable sign up vs. log in functionalities. It should be noted that the sign up form and log in<br>
    point to nowhere at this stage as there is a need for backend design to ensure a fully functional sign up and log in form.<br> 
    <li>Contact us form does not go beyond what is displayed on Contact Us page as well since there is a need for backend design.<br>
</ul>
